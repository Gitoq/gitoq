`gitoq` is a cli to share env files with high security in minimum time between environments and team members.

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gitoq.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/gitoq)

## üå± Install

It works with a single command:

```sh
npx gitoq
```

## üöÄ Quick start

Start the process of synchronizing, managing and deploying your passwords using the Quick Start Guide:

```sh
gitoq login
```

That's it. now you need to connect your project. run the connect command:

```sh
gitoq connect
```

Nice! You can use the following command to synchronize this env:

```sh
gitoq pull
```

```sh
gitoq push
```

After connecting the project we will create an `env.gitoq.lock` file to track the project. you can
commit and push your `env.gitoq.lock` file safely to a version controller like git.

## üèóÔ∏è Usage

‚≠ê Note: Our intention regarding the file `ENV` is the file `.env` or `.env.local`. We will create one of them for you based on their presence in your source code (priority is given to `.env`).

Now you can get the latest changes of your main env (by default `development`):

```bash
gitoq pull
```

If you don't have the env.local file, we'll create it for you and monitor your changes. Be careful, if it already exists, we'll change its content. (You can change it before running this command to send your env.local first)

When you make a change to your `ENV` file, push it up:

```sh
gitoq push
```

## üëΩ Manage Multiple Environments

After you've pushed your `ENV` file, gitoq automatically sets up your main env. Manage multiple environments with the included UI. [learn more](https://www.gitoq.com)

```sh
gitoq pull -l
```

That's it! Manage your ci, staging, and production secrets from there.

Would you also like to pull your production `.env` to your machine? Run the command:

```sh
gitoq pull -l
```
